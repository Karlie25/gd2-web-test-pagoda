		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Linh Ung-Ba Na is around 1,500 meters above sea level. Linh Ung pagoda is an excellent place where visitors can take a good look at the Gare De Bay terminal's French-style mansion nestled in the jungle. Standing there, visitors can also have a bird's-eye view of the jungle and the city below.
		<br>
		The pagoda's most striking thing is the 27-meter-high white Shakyamuni Buddha Statue with the octagonal base having a story about the eight stages of the Buddha's life.
